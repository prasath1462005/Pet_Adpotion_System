I have developed a fullstackProject using Spring framework for backend and mysql database and html ,css for frontend and 
Thymleaf(server-side java template).In this website shelter can post their pets and adopter can adopt those pets by communicating with the shelter
and there are other features as well.
Pet/src/main/java/com/example/Pet path to get the spring mvc architecture code.
Pet/src/main/resources/templates path to get the frontend code.
